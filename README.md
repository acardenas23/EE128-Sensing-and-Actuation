# EE128-Sensing-and-Actuation
This contains all my labs and projects for EE168, Sensing and Actuation for Embedded Systems. I programmed the K64F board using the Kinetis Studio IDE. Some of the topics covered in my labs and projects include:
Writing to GPIO Pins
Using Serial Communication Protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C
ADC Conversions
implementing Interrupts
configuring the K64F for PWM
Stepper motor Control
