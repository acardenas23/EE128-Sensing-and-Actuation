# EE128-Sensing-and-Actuation
This contains all my labs and projects for EE168, Sensing and Actuation for Embedded Systems. I programmed the K64F board using the Kinetis Studio IDE. Some of the topics covered in my labs and projects include: <br />
Writing to GPIO Pins <br /> 
Using Serial Communication Protocols such as UART, SPI, and I2C <br />
ADC Conversions <br /> 
implementing Interrupts <br />
configuring the K64F for PWM <br />
Stepper motor Control <br />
